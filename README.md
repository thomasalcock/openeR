# openeR

## Description
The **openeR** package was created for developers to comfortably document their R code.
Whether you're doing exploratory analyses, writing data prep sctipts or just plain experimenting around, 
your code might not be as functional as if you were writing a package. 
If it were, you'd just use the excellent **roxygen2** package.

However, you still want to standardize your documentation across scripts, right? 
Inserting the same opening documentation for your script can be a hassle (all of that copying and pasting, ugh!).

Enter **openeR**: This package allows you to easily set up standardized doc strings in your script, which (for now)
contain the following:

1. The project ID or name
2. A brief description / classification of the script
3. The contributors to the script
4. The date at which the documentation was set up
5. A more detailed summary of the scripts contents
